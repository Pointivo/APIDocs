# Plans

[Plans](plans.md) are pre-packaged, labeled sets of [Features](features.md). Plans define the base price, billing cycle for [subscriptions](subscriptions.md). For example, you might have a $5/month plan that provides limited access to a product, and a $15/month plan that allows full access.
